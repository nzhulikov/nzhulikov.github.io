## Welcome out of here!

Hello, space-time traveler! You are reading my personal blog right now.

I write about how I solve my problems. Why read it? Because you may want to solve the same problems better than me.

My blog is mostly about software development, but this is not the only kind of problems I face.

This post is a result of a curving of gravitational field due to propagating gravitational waves, spawned by two neutron stars crashed together in the deep space. Read more about it [here](https://www.space.com/38471-gravitational-waves-neutron-star-crashes-discovery-explained.html).

Scared that Earth will be sucked inside of a black hole someday? Or destroyed by an asteroid? Then fight your fears [in this game](https://nzhulikov.github.io/defendearth.html)!
